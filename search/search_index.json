Format : A 50 character string Additional information : You can generate a secret key using this tool if needed. ALLOWED_HOSTS \u00b6 Description : A list of hostnames that Mathesar will be accessible at ( see Django docs ). Hostnames should not contain the protocol (e.g. http ) or trailing slashes. You can use localhost in this list. Format : Comma separated string of hostnames Valid values mathesar.example.com, localhost .localhost, mathesar.example.com, 35.188.184.125 Invalid values http://mathesar.example.com/ - contains HTTP protocol and a trailing slash https://mathesar.example.com - contains HTTPS protocol localhost/, 35.188.184.125 - contains trailing slash after localhost DJANGO_DATABASE_URL \u00b6 Description : A Postgres connection string of the database used for Mathesar\u2019s internal usage . Format : postgres://user:password@hostname:port/database_name The connection string above will connect to a database with username user , password password , hostname mathesar_db , port 5432 , and database name mathesar_django . MATHESAR_DATABASES \u00b6 Description : Names and connection information for databases managed by Mathesar. These databases will be accessible through the UI. Format : (unique_id|connection_string),(unique_id|connection_string),... e.g. (db1|postgresql://u:p@example.com:5432/db1),(db2|postgresql://u:p@example.com:5432/db2) This would set Mathesar to connect to two databases, db1 and db2 which are both accessed via the same user u , password p , hostname example.com , and port 5432 .

Requirements \u00b6 System \u00b6 We recommend having at least 60 GB disk space and 4 GB of RAM. Operating System \u00b6 We\u2019ve tested this on Ubuntu , but we expect that it can be adapted for other Linux distributions as well. Access \u00b6 You should have root access to the machine you\u2019re installing Mathesar on. Software \u00b6 You\u2019ll need to install the following system packages before you install Mathesar: Python 3.9 Python version Python older than 3.9 will not run Mathesar. Python newer than 3.9 will run Mathesar, but will require some slightly modified installation steps which we have not yet documented . PostgreSQL 13 or newer (Verify with psql --version ) NodeJS 14 or newer (Verify with node --version ) (This is required for installation only and will eventually be relaxed ) npm 6 or newer (Verify with npm --version ) (This is required for installation only and will eventually be relaxed ) Caddy (Verify with caddy version ) git (Verify with git --version ) Domain (optional) \u00b6 If you want Mathesar to be accessible over the internet, you\u2019ll probably want to set up a domain or sub-domain to use. If you don\u2019t need a domain, you can skip this section. Before you start installation, ensure that the DNS for your sub-domain or domain is pointing to the machine that you\u2019re installing Mathesar on . Customizing this Guide \u00b6 Type your domain name into the box below. Do not include a trailing slash. Then press Enter to customize this guide with your domain name. Installation Steps \u00b6 Set up the database \u00b6 Open a psql shell. sudo -u postgres psql Mathesar needs a Postgres superuser to function correctly. Let\u2019s create a superuser. CREATE USER mathesar WITH SUPERUSER ENCRYPTED PASSWORD '1234' ; Customize your password Be sure to change the password 1234 in the command above to something more secure and private. Record your custom password somewhere safe. You will need to reference it later. Next, we have to create a database for storing Mathesar metadata. CREATE DATABASE mathesar_django ; Now we let us create a database for storing your data. CREATE DATABASE your_db_name ; Press Ctrl + D to exit the psql shell. Set up your installation directory \u00b6 Choose a directory to store the Mathesar application files. Examples /home/my_user_name/mathesar /etc/mathesar Type your installation directory into the box below. Do not include a trailing slash. Then press Enter to customize this guide with your installation directory. Create your installation directory. mkdir -p xMATHESAR_INSTALLATION_DIRx When installing outside your home folder If you choose a directory outside your home folder, then you\u2019ll need to create it with sudo and choose an appropriate owner for the directory (i.e. root or a custom user of your choosing). The remainder of this guide requires you to run commands with full permissions inside your installation directory . You can do this, for example via: chown my_user_name: xMATHESAR_INSTALLATION_DIRx Or sudo su Navigate into your installation directory. cd xMATHESAR_INSTALLATION_DIRx The remaining commands in this guide should be run from within your installation directory. Set up the environment \u00b6 Clone the git repo into the installation directory. git clone https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar.git . Checkout the tag of the latest stable release, 0.1.3 . git checkout 0.1.3 Important If you don\u2019t run the above command you\u2019ll end up installing the latest development version of Mathesar, which will be less stable. Tip You can install a specific Mathesar release by running commands like git checkout 0.1.1 (to install version 0.1.1, for example). You can see all available versions by running git tag .

We recommend /etc/mathesar , but it can be any directory. sudo mkdir -p /etc/mathesar cd /etc/mathesar Download our docker-compose.yml , and .env.example files to the directory you\u2019ve chosen. sudo wget https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar/raw/0.1.3/docker-compose.yml sudo wget https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar/raw/0.1.3/.env.example Rename .env.example to .env sudo mv .env.example .env Your custom .env file will be used for setting configuration variables . Set up the database To use the default database server bundled with Mathesar, no additional steps are necessary. The database service will start along with the Mathesar web server. Alternatively, you can disable the default database server if you plan on using an existing database server . Set up the web server. Edit your .env file, making the following changes: Add the Backend Configuration environment variables Customize the values of the environment variables to suit your needs. Example If you are using the default database container , your .env file should look something like this ALLOWED_HOSTS = '<your_domain_name>' SECRET_KEY = 'dee551f449ce300ee457d339dcee9682eb1d6f96b8f28feda5283aaa1a21' DJANGO_DATABASE_URL = 'postgresql://mathesar:mathesar@mathesar_db:5432/mathesar_django' MATHESAR_DATABASES = '(mathesar_tables|postgresql://mathesar:mathesar@mathesar_db:5432/mathesar)' Start the Mathesar web server.

Just follow the instructions on screen. Starting and stopping Mathesar \u00b6 The Mathesar server needs to be running for you to use Mathesar. If you restart your machine, you\u2019ll need to start the server again. Start Mathesar: Linux MacOS sudo docker compose -f /etc/mathesar/docker-compose.yml up -d docker compose -f /etc/mathesar/docker-compose.yml up -d Stop Mathesar: Linux MacOS sudo docker compose -f /etc/mathesar/docker-compose.yml down docker compose -f /etc/mathesar/docker-compose.yml down This stops all Mathesar Docker containers and releases their ports. Note If you customized the Mathesar configuration directory during installation, you\u2019ll need to change /etc/mathesar to your configuration directory.

In this case, you need only stop the script by pressing CTRL+C , and then run it again. When installing on Windows \u00b6 Warning The process of installing and running has thus far been much better tested on MacOS and Linux than it has on Windows. Please open issues for any Windows-specific problems you encounter. During installation, choose \u201cWSL 2\u201d instead of \u201cHyper-V\u201d.

Make sure you\u2019re use the WSL command prompt (rather than DOS or PowerShell) when running the installation script and other commands. Docker versions \u00b6 The most common problem we\u2019ve encountered is users with out-of-date docker or docker-compose versions. To determine your docker-compose version, run docker compose version . (Note the lack of hyphen.) You need docker-compose version 2.7 or higher for the installation to succeed. Better if it\u2019s version 2.10 or higher. To determine your docker version, run docker --version . We\u2019ve tested with docker version 23, but lower versions may work. If you run docker-compose --version and see a relatively old version, try docker compose version and see whether it\u2019s different. The latter is the version that will be used in the script. Ports \u00b6 You may see errors about various ports being unavailable (or already being bound). In this case, uninstall Mathesar to restart from a clean docker state, and choose non-default ports during the installation process for PostgreSQL, HTTP traffic, or HTTPS traffic as appropriate, e.g., using 8080 for HTTP traffic if 80 is unavailable. Note that if you customized the configuration directory, you must replace /etc/mathesar with that custom directory in the command. Connection problems \u00b6 In order for Mathesar to install properly, it needs to download some artifacts from https://raw.githubusercontent.com . We\u2019ve received some reports that this domain is blocked for some internet providers in India. If this is the case for you, consider routing around that problem via a custom DNS server, or using a VPN. Permissions \u00b6 If you have permissions issues when the script begins running docker commands, double-check that your user is in the sudoers file. Try running sudo -v . If that gives an error, your user lacks needed permissions and you should speak with the administrator of your system.

What does the script do? \u00b6 Our guided installation script performs the following steps. Operating system check \u00b6 The installer attempts to determine what operating system you\u2019re installing Mathesar on. We\u2019ve tested with some variants of macOS as well as a few distros of Linux. Some logic in the installer branches based on your operating system. Docker version check \u00b6 The installer double-checks your Docker and Docker Compose versions, making sure that docker is at least version 20.0.0, and docker-compose is at least version 2.10.0. Database configuration \u00b6 Mathesar uses two PostgreSQL databases: an internal database , used to store Mathesar related metadata such as display options. This is set up on the same machine as Mathesar\u2019s deployment. the user database , which stores your data. You can either set up a new database from scratch for this purpose or connect an existing PostgreSQL database. If you\u2019re setting a database up from scratch, the installer will set up credentials for both databases (a username and password), and also lets you customize the name of your user database. If you\u2019re connecting an existing database, you\u2019ll enter pre-existing credentials for the user database and set up new credentials for the Mathesar internal database. The credentials created in this section are used to log in directly to the database (i.e., not the Mathesar UI). You\u2019ll set up login credentials for the UI in a later step. Finally, Mathesar helps you customize the port exposed to your host machine from the database container. This is useful, since you\u2019ll need to have an exposed port to login to the Mathesar database(s) using an alternate client such as psql , but there could be a conflict on the default port (e.g. for the case that a PostgreSQL instance is running in the host OS). Webserver configuration \u00b6 This section lets you configure the entrypoint (Caddy) for every request you send to Mathesar. You may need to customize the ports if you have other services using ports on your machine. Additionally, you need to configure either a domain or an external IP address if you plan to expose your installation of Mathesar to the internet. Setting up the domain also gets HTTPS working properly on your Mathesar installation. Domain setup \u00b6 The domain specified here should be a valid, registered domain, whose DNS entry points to the IP address of the server on which Mathesar is installed. DNS configuration should be done ahead of time. If you don\u2019t use a domain, Mathesar can still be accessed from the internet using an IP address instead a domain name. Please note that HTTPS will not work without a domain name set up. Admin user configuration \u00b6 Here, the installer helps you create a user (separate from the database user) that you will use to login to Mathesar through the main web UI. This section walks you through that process to create a username and password for that user. You\u2019re allowed to use the same details as the database user above, but it\u2019s not required, or particularly recommended. The user created in this section will have admin privileges in Mathesar, and be able to create other users after the installation is complete. Configuration directory \u00b6 We need to store all the details configured above, and we do so in a file in your configuration directory. Note that this contains your passwords and other secrets, so it should be kept secure . By default, this directory is /etc/mathesar/ , but you can change it. We\u2019ll store two files under that directory: .env : This file has the above-mentioned configurations. docker-compose.yml This is a config file downloaded from Mathesar\u2019s git repo. It defines the different Docker containers used by Mathesar, and how they\u2019re networked together. Recommended permissions for the .env file are: -rw------- 1 root root 449 Feb 22 13:39 /etc/mathesar/.env Docker setup \u00b6 The installer downloads the docker-compose.yml file from Mathesar\u2019s repo. The installer pulls all Docker images needed for Mathesar to run properly, and starts the various services in sequence. Final steps \u00b6 If everything has worked, then the installer prints a message letting you know that it\u2019s succeeded, and gives a little information about where you should go to login to Mathesar. Docker containers created \u00b6 This installation process creates the following containers: mathesar_service , which runs the main Mathesar application. mathesar_db , which runs the database (PostgreSQL 13). mathesar-caddy-reverse-proxy-1 , which helps route traffic to the mathesar_service container. mathesar-watchtower-1 , which helps upgrade Mathesar installation when new releases are available. Files involved \u00b6 This installation process creates the following files in the Mathesar configuration directory: .env . This file defines the environment inside of the various Mathesar docker containers. It should be kept safe, since it has sensitive information about the passwords you set for Mathesar. If you\u2019ve forgotten your admin username or password, look at this file. docker-compose.yml . This is the main file defining the Mathesar containers listed above, and the connections between them.","title":"Under the hood"},{"location":"installation/guided-install/under-the-hood/#guided-installation-under-the-hood","text":"This document is related to our guided installation .","title":"Guided installation: under the hood"},{"location":"installation/guided-install/under-the-hood/#what-does-the-script-do","text":"Our guided installation script performs the following steps.","title":"What does the script do?"},{"location":"installation/guided-install/under-the-hood/#operating-system-check","text":"The installer attempts to determine what operating system you\u2019re installing Mathesar on.
